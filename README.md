# typescript-react-boilerplate

Bare-bones setup for a typescript-based project suitable for enterprise use.

"enterprise use" means:

* automated integration and functional testing
* strong organization for group use / extension
* documented recipes for doing common / uncommon tasks
* minimal tech dependencies

the chosen stack here includes:

* node v5
* typescript
* angular 2 (for front-end)
* express (for back-end)
* live-server (for angular dev testing)
* intern (for unit / functional testing)

We use npm for builds rather than gulp / grunt
